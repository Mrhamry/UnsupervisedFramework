# Redefining Privacy Policy Summarisation: A Contextualised Sentence Embedding Approach

In this project, we suggest the use of an unsupervised approach to identify the privacy practices in privacy policies. We developed a framework utilizing state-of-the-art AI models along with other processing methods.

We introduce **Policy-Oriented BERT**, a privacy policy-specific BERT model that is pre-trained from scratch on a large corpus containing over 451K privacy policy documents.

**Resources:**
- **Policy-Oriented BERT (Weights):** Download from [here](insert-link).
- **451K Privacy Policy Corpus:** Used for pretraining our custom Policy-Oriented BERT, downloadable from [here](insert-link).

As stated in our paper, we implemented MEAN-strategy pooling with the Policy-Oriented BERT model to produce superior results when generating sentence embeddings.
